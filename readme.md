This project will download the entire git history for a repository (contributors, contributions, etc) into an excel sheet.  For recruiters / sourcers out there, this means emails for every person that contributed to a repo, as well as metadata about everything that they contributed (what and when).

I made this awhile back and am working on something else now in a different space, so I thought I would share freely.  For what it's worth, this is the secret sauce to a popular sourcing platform for developers that companies spend thousands of dollars a month on.  Here it is free.

To run this project:
- enter chrome:extensions in the browser URL bar
- make sure developer mode in the top right corner is on
- hit the load unpacked button and select the chrome directory

Then just go to any repo and hit the extension icon in the top right corner.  The extension will start to process the entire git history directly in your browser, then download an excel sheet with everything from it when it's done.  Keep in mind that larger repos will take longer than smaller ones to download, but a download will come.

If this is useful to you, share it with others.
